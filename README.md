# Split-Ease

## The easing curve with a beginning, middle and end.
## The easing library that's actually easy.

Split-Ease generates uniquely powerful and flexible easing functions for JavaScript animation, by interpolating through separate *acceleration*, *constant-speed*, and *deceleration* segments in variable proportion and curvature.

See [the demo]().

## Installation

## API
 (in, constant, out). It integrates "power" and "sine" polynomial curves (such as popularized by Robert Penner c. 2001), in a manner that allows independently-variable proportion and curvature.
