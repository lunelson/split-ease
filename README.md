SplitEase.js is a JavaScript function which offers animators and creative coders a means to compose separately timed variable __acceleration__, __constant-speed__ and __deceleration__ segments in a single continous interpolation. It weighs less than 1k.

For an interactive visualisation of its simple numeric API [see the homepage]().

## Backstory

Most strictly-timed (i.e. not simulation-based) animation on the web makes use of interpolation (easing) functions originally popularized by [Robert Penner](http://robertpenner.com/easing/) in his [2002 book on programming Flash MX](http://robertpenner.com/profmx/). This book proposed 10 curve-types (Sine, Quad, Cubic, Quart, Quint, Exp, Back, Circ, Elastic, Bounce) times 3 variations (easeIn, easeOut and easeInOut), to offer [30 different patterns of movement](https://easings.net/en).

SplitEase addresses the problem of deciding between the most common of these patterns, by composing the underlying math of the Sine and Power (Quad, Cubic, Quart, Quint) curves in a way that makes their ease-in/-out/-in-out proportions and their power curvature independently variable.

## Getting started

### Install

Via npm install

```bash
$ npm install split-ease --save
```
```js
// import in ES6+
import SplitEase from 'split-ease';

// â€¦or require in CommonJS
const SplitEase = require('split-ease);
```

Via unpkg script include
```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/split-ease" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

or manual [download]() and include a script link to the UMD version.

```html
<script src="split-ease/dist/split-ease.umd.js"></script>
```

## Documentation

#### 1. Midpoint mode

- single numeric argument + options obj
- default curve is power, default exponent is 2
- et1 is basically the amount of the time (duration) that should be taken up by the ease-in portion. The ease-out portion will take up the remaining amount


#### 2. Split mode

- two numeric arguments + options obj
- et1 is the amount of easing time that should be taken up by the ease-in portion
- et2 is the proportional duration of the ease-out portion of the curve. If the total of et1 and et2 is less than 1, there will be a constant-speed segment in between them.

### Advantages

- a drop-in replacement for the entire power range of penner curves, as well as all power curves in between those, plus the sine curve.
- independently controllable ease-in and ease-out timing, while overall duration and displacement remain strict
- e.g. you cannot accurately simulate separately timed acceleration, constant-speed and deceleration of movemement over a strict displacement (e.g. distance) with any standard curves, including cubic-bezier and GSAP's Custom Ease
- you could simulate the movement accurately with Vector math, but doing so over a specified time and displacement is very complex.

### Installation

SplitEase can be installed via NPM or loaded via RawGit/UnPkg. The package includes UMD, CommonJS and ES Module flavors.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @lunelson/split-ease
```
```js
// ES Module
import SplitEase from 'split-ease';
```
```js
// Common JS
const SplitEase = require('split-ease);
```
```html
<!-- HTML script tag -->
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

### Usage

The SplitEase function accepts timing and curve options, and configures and returns an ease function which accepts a single parameter in the range of `0` to `1`. This signature conforms to the APIs of most animation libraries.

```js
```

See the [docs for more examples]().

### Background/Origins


SplitEase is an alternative easing function for animation, that combines variable ease-in, -out and linear segments in a single interpolation.

Play with the demo.
