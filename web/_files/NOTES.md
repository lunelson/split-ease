1. clear description
2. how it could be useful
3. why it is important
  ->
4. difference from analogs/competitors
5. highlight relevant stats: low size, simple code, no issues, no dependencies
  -> see bundlephobia


- use bold to highlight keywords
- use bullets and sections
- use image and/or code-sample early
- add a step-by-step starting guide, be very specific
- add social proof: who uses it, who made cool stuff
  -> call for people to share it, and report whether they are using it!


## breakdown

POINTS
small, modular

WHY
Easing is hard to understand.
The math is complex or at least daunting.
A lot of articles confuse the issue, WRT what an easing function is.

DIFF/IMPORTANCE
first new algorithm since 2001
it is recommended by... / it is used by...

There is a standard set that's been around since 2001
## why

## what

Split-Ease wraps up the core Penner equations in to a single simpler API, while offering the ability to time the in and out segments of the ease separately, even in combination with a middle constant-speed segment.

Covers the sine and power curves from Penner's original set (everything except back bounce elastic and circ expo variants).

## exceptions

There are some eases in the common set that are not covered by Sine or Power, these are the "Back" (overshoot) and "Bounce" or "Elastic" (springy) types. These use different curve functions to emulate a physical effect. The true physical effects behind these can be more accurately simulated with Spring physics math, but then they cannot be strictly timed.

## Arguments

a lot of articles confuse

## FAQs

### how does this differ from the half-way type of easing

I'm not sure what to call it but there's another way of doing easing, mostly used for creating ease-out curves, in which you recursively move part of the way toward the final value, which produced a tapering progression. This type of curve is actually poor for animation because it's not strictly timeable, it doesn't approximate any real physical motion, and it's actually infinitely long (it only seems to end, because at a certain point values close to zero are just rounded to zero).

### how does this differ from cubic-bezier

actually a lot of resources confuse cubic-bezier curves with the original 'penner' curve set, implying that bezier curves can cover each use-case, which isn't quite true. Sine and Power curves can only be generated by Sine and Power functions. A Bezier curve can approximate those curvatures but the math behind them is totally different.
